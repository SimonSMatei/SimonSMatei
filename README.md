## Welcome! I'm Simon Matei👋

I'm a Computer Science student at Tennessee Tech, with a concentration in Data Science and AI. My academic path is supported by strategic minors in Mathematics (for algorithmic theory) and Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) (for critical insight into high-performance computing and systems architecture). I'm a highly driven individual committed to learning and developing skills related to Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Development. 

## My Experience 🔬

NSF Summer Research Intern - Fisk University:

* Characterized NaI(Tl) scintillator crystals for radiation detection.

* Built 8+ Python tools compatible with Windows 11 and XP for data fitting, decay analysis, and large dataset processing, reducing analysis time.

  * Automated preprocessing of 32,000+ data channels and 16 inputs into structured files.

  * Designed waveform isolation algorithms that reduced datasets from 50,000+ events to a few thousand in seconds.

  * Built automated Gaussian fit and decay analysis pipelines, cutting processing time from
hours to seconds.

* Developed cross-version tools compatible with both Windows 11 and legacy Windows XP systems, ensuring usability.

* Produced statistical reports, visualizations, and research-ready outputs for presentations, eliminating manual file transfers and saving 2+ hours per analysis cycle.

## I’m currently learning 🌱

I'm currently learning the fundamentals of Data Science and Machine learning using Python outside of my course curriculum.

## Next Steps 🎯

I am actively seeking Summer 2026 Computer Science / Data Science Internships. Let's connect!
